# My dotfiles

#### All the customization is very basic. Not even close to finished, haven't had time. 

I use the catpuccin mocha theme with a black background for oled on mako, kitty, helix and nvim.
Using Astronvim vanilla with only the greeting and theme changed.
sway is also very basic: I use fuzzel to launch apps. 
I've switched from kitty to foot but havent had time to configure foot yet.
